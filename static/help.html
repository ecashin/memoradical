<h2>Local Only App</h2>
<p>This web app runs on your browser and stores information on your local system.</p>
<p>
    Your information never leaves your system.
    It only requests HTML and
    <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a>
    from the server.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To flip the card, click "Flip" or hit the "f" key.</p>
<p>If you know the meaning of the word, click "Hit" or hit the "h" key.</p>
<p>If you do not know the meaning of the word, click "Miss" or hit the "m" key.</p>
<p>To go to the next card without hitting or missing, click "Next" or hit the "n" key.</p>
<p>
    To go to the previous card without hitting or missing, click "Prev" or hit the "p" key.
    After you go backward, going forward results in new random draws for cards.

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>
    In "Add Card" mode, you can add one card at a time.
</p>
<p>
    To add many at once, visit "All Cards" mode and work with your
    <a href="https://www.json.org">JSON data</a>
    outside Memoradical.
    In "All Cards" mode, you can copy the data, upload new or edited data, and see all the cards.
</p>
<p>
    Use the "Choose File" button
    at the top to upload a JSON file with new cards.
    You can replace all the existing ones ("overwrite"),
    or you can add the new ones to the existing ones.
    Remember that HTML5 local storage does have a browser-dependent limit.
</p>
<p>
    Use the "Copy to Clipboard" button
    and paste the JSON-format data into a text file for backup or processing.
</p>
<h2>Card Selection During Study</h2>
<p>Misses make cards appear more frequently, but hits make them appear less frequently.</p>
<p>If no data is available, dummy cards are displayed.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>After going through a few cards, use "p" to go back through recent history.</p>
<p>If you still don't remember, you can record another miss and use "p" again twice to resume time travel.</p>
<p>Going back through history removes items from the history.</p>
<p>The history is limited to a length on the order of the logarithm of the number of cards.</p>
<p>Visit the "Stats" mode to see your overall progress.</p>
